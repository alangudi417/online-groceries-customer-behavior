## Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis

### 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behavior using transactional data from Instacart, an online grocery delivery platform. The objective is to identify patterns in how, when, and what customers purchase to generate insights that support marketing optimization and operational decision-making.

Using five interconnected datasets — orders, products, order_products, aisles, and departments — the project performs extensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover consumer habits, product popularity trends, and reorder behavior.
The analysis simulates real-world data challenges, including missing values, duplicate records, and data inconsistencies, providing a practical demonstration of data cleaning and analytical problem-solving skills.

### 📊 Dataset Description
The project uses five relational datasets:

- orders: Customer order history and timing information
- products: Product catalog details
- order_products: Mapping between orders and purchased products
- aisles: Product aisle categorization
- departments: High-level product groupings

These datasets enable multi-dimensional analysis of customer purchasing patterns and product relationships.
